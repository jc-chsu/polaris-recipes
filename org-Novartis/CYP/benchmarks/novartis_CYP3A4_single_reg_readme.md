## Background

Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes are membrane-bound hemeproteins that play a key role in metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics. Most drugs are mainly metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP450), which can lead to drugâ€“drug interactions (DDI). Specifically, time-dependent inhibition (TDI) of CYP3A4 isoenzyme has been associated with clinically relevant DDI. To overcome potential DDI issues, high-throughput in vitro assays were established to assess the TDI of CYP3A4 during the discovery and lead optimization phases.

## Benchmarking
**The goal** of this benchmark is to perform a single task, which is to have the best predictive model for CYP3A4 inactivation rate **log_kobs**. 


## Description of readout 
- **Readouts**: `log_kobs`
- **Bioassay readout**: CYP3A4 inactivation rate

## Molecule data resource:
**Reference**: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemrestox.3c00305

## Train/test split
In this benchmark set, the train/test sets in the above paper are used.
