## Background
The volume of distribution at steady state (VDss) measures the degree of a drug's concentration in body tissue compared to concentration in blood. Higher VD indicates a higher distribution in the tissue and usually indicates the drug with high lipid solubility, low plasma protein binidng rate.

## Description of readout
Task Description: Regression. Given a drug SMILES string, predict the volume of distributon.
