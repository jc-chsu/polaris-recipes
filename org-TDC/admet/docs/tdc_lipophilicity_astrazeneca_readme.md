## Background
Lipophilicity measures the ability of a drug to dissolve in a lipid (e.g. fats, oils) environment. High lipophilicity often leads to high rate of metabolism, poor solubility, high turn-over, and low absorption. From MoleculeNet.

## Description of readout
Task Description: Regression. Given a drug SMILES string, predict the activity of lipophilicity.
