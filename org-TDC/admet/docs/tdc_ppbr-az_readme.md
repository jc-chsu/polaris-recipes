## Background
The human plasma protein binding rate (PPBR) is expressed as the percentage of a drug bound to plasma proteins in the blood. This rate strongly affect a drug's efficiency of delivery. The less bound a drug is, the more efficiently it can traverse and diffuse to the site of actions. From a ChEMBL assay deposited by AstraZeneca.

## Description of readout
Task Description: Regression. Given a drug SMILES string, predict the rate of PPBR.
