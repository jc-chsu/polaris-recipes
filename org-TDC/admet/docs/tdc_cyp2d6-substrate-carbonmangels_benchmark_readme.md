## Background
CYP2D6 is primarily expressed in the liver. It is also highly expressed in areas of the central nervous system, including the substantia nigra. TDC used a dataset from [1], which merged information on substrates and nonsubstrates from six publications.

## Description of readout
Task Description: Binary Classification. Given a drug SMILES string, predict if it is a substrate to the enzyme.
