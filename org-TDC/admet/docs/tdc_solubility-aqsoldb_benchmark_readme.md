## Background
Aqeuous solubility measures a drug's ability to dissolve in water. Poor water solubility could lead to slow drug absorptions, inadequate bioavailablity and even induce toxicity. More than 40% of new chemical entities are not soluble.

## Description of readout
Task Description: Regression. Given a drug SMILES string, predict the activity of solubility.
