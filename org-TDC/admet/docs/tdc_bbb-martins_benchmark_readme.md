## Background
As a membrane separating circulating blood and brain extracellular fluid, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is the protection layer that blocks most foreign drugs. Thus the ability of a drug to penetrate the barrier to deliver to the site of action forms a crucial challenge in development of drugs for central nervous system From MoleculeNet.

## Description of readout
Task Description: Binary classification. Given a drug SMILES string, predict the activity of BBB.
