## Background
The human colon epithelial cancer cell line, Caco-2, is used as an in vitro model to simulate the human intestinal tissue. The experimental result on the rate of drug passing through the Caco-2 cells can approximate the rate at which the drug permeates through the human intestinal tissue.

## Description of readout
Task Description: Regression. Given a drug SMILES string, predict the Caco-2 cell effective permeability.
