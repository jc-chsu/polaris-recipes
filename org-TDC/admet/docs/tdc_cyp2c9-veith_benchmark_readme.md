## Background
The CYP P450 genes are involved in the formation and breakdown (metabolism) of various molecules and chemicals within cells. Specifically, the CYP P450 2C9 plays a major role in the oxidation of both xenobiotic and endogenous compounds.

## Description of readout
Task Description: Binary Classification. Given a drug SMILES string, predict CYP2C9 inhibition.
