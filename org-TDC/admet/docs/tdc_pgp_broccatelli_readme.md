## Background
P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is an ABC transporter protein involved in intestinal absorption, drug metabolism, and brain penetration, and its inhibition can seriously alter a drug's bioavailability and safety. In addition, inhibitors of Pgp can be used to overcome multidrug resistance.

## Description of readout
Task Description: Binary classification. Given a drug SMILES string, predict the activity of Pgp inhibition.
