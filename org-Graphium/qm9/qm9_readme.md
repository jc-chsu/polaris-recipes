## Background
QM9 is a well-known dataset in the field of 3D GNNs. It consists of 19 graph-level quantum properties associated to an energy-minimized 3D conformation of the molecules [1]. It is considered a simple dataset since all the molecules have at most 9 heavy atoms. We chose QM9 in our ToyMix since it is very similar to the larger proposed quantum datasets, PCQM4M_multitask and PM6_83M, but with smaller molecules
