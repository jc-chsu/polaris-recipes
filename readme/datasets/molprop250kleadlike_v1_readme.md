**Molecular Properties Datasets**

ZINC is a widely utilized public access database and tool set, playing a crucial role in various applications including virtual screening, ligand discovery, pharmacophore screens, benchmarking, and force field development. The **MolProp250KLeadlike** dataset consists of 250,000 leadlike compounds randomly selected from ZINC25.

The ZINC22 is published in https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.2c01253 and the dataset is downloaded from https://cartblanche22.docking.org \

To **maintain consistency** with other benchmarks in the Polaris Hub, a thorough data curation process is carried out to ensure the accuracy of molecular presentations.
Therefore, the raw data from the data resource is not used here.
