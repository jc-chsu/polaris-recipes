## Background
The Drug Design Data Resource (D3R) aims to advance the technology of computer-aided drug discovery through the interchange of high quality protein-ligand datasets and workflows, and by holding community-wide, blinded prediction challenges. The D3R project is based at the University of California San Diego (UCSD), where it is co-directed by Drs. Rommie Amaro and Michael Gilson. An additional D3R component, focused on determining, validating and archiving protein-ligand co-crystal structures, is hosted at Rutgers the State University of New Jersey and led by Dr. Stephen K. Burley, who is Director of the RCSB Protein Data Bank.

## Assay Information
The cathepsins constitute an 11-member family of proteases involved in protein degradation. Cathepsin S is highly expressed in antigen-presenting cells, where it degrades major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II)-associated invariant chain. CatS is a candidate target for regulating immune hyper-responsiveness, as the inhibition of CatS may limit antigen presentation. This data set comprises a follow-on challenge to GC3, consisting of non-peptidic, non-covalent, small molecule inhibitors across a three order of magnitude range (nM to Î¼M) of IC50s for CatS. Specifically, we provide 459 CatS inhibitors for affinity prediction. This dataset was kindly donated by Janssen. Please note the affinity values from this set were measured against a C25S CatS mutant.
