## Background
This is part of a release of experimental data determined at AstraZeneca on a set of compounds in the following assays: pKa, lipophilicity (LogD7.4), aqueous solubility, plasma protein binding (human, rat, dog , mouse and guinea pig), intrinsic clearance (human liver microsomes, human and rat hepatocytes). 

## Assay Information
Hepatic metabolic stability is a key pharmacokinetic parameter in drug discovery. Metabolic stability is usually assessed in microsomal fractions and only the best compounds progress in the drug discovery process. A high-throughput single time point substrate depletion method in rat liver microsomes (RLM) is employed at the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) as a Tier 1 assay. Between 2012 and 2020, RLM stability (in vitro half-life) data was generated for ~24,000 compounds from more than 250 NCATS projects that cover a wide range of pharmacological targets and cellular pathways. Data for ~2500 compounds along with the global prediction models are publicly available.

Microsomes are small membrane bubbles (vesicles) that come from a fragmented cell membrane, and can be used as a proxy for how well a drug survives a trip through the liver.

## Description of readout:
- **HLM_CLEARANCE**: Intrinsic clearance measured in human liver microsomes following incubation at 37C. Experimental range <3 to >150 microL/min/mg. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2010, 24, 1730-1736.
